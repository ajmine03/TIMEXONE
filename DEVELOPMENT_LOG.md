## Milestone 1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

### Date: 2026-09-22

### Completed
- Selected technology stack: Python 3.13 + PyQt6 + SQLite (ideal for Linux desktop integration, native Freedesktop system tray, multi-monitor floating always-on-top window, low RAM ~40MB, and Debian packaging).
- Initialized project directory structure:
  - `focusflow/` (core engine, database persistence, modern UI views, components, system utilities)
  - `tests/` (unit testing suite)
  - `packaging/debian/` (Debian packaging specifications)
  - `assets/` (scalable app logo and notification audio)
- Created `.gitignore` ignoring virtual environments, test caches, local SQLite databases, and packaging build artifacts.
- Created `LICENSE` (MIT).
- Designed vector application icon `assets/focusflow.svg`.
- Synthesized soft dual-tone notification chime `assets/chime.wav` using harmonic wave synthesis.

### Git Commits
- `chore: initialize project structure, assets, and git development tracking`

### Next Planned Milestone
- Implement SQLite persistence layer with schema migrations (`focusflow/db/`).
